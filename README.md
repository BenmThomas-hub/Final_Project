# String Search II

String search is an algorithm designed to find the occurrences of a smaller set of text within a larger set of text.
This is done by comparing characters in the texts with eachother until the larger text is run through and all opf the occurences of the smaller text is found.

# Instructions

When running the program attached, you are first able to choose between running one of the algorithms or creating a benchmark plot file comparing the two algorithms.
If the algorithm path is chosen, you are then able to input the larger text first and then the text you would like to search for.
You are then able to choose between running the Knuth Morris Prat Algorithm or the Boyer Moore Algorithm.
After an option is made, the program will output the amount of occurences of the string and the time it took for the program to run in nanoseconds.
The program will then repeat until the option to end it is chosen.
